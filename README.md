# Human-Computer-Interaction-HCI-for-Assisted-Living-of-Paralysed-Patients
Designed an embedded eye frame with an on-board CMOS camera that uses Video Processing and Template Matching Correlation algorithms to monitor eye blink patterns of a paralyzed patient in order to provide them with a pre-recorded voice command toolbox that can assist patients to relay emergency signals and messages to the caretaker. An Eclipse IDE designed GUI gives them the ability to wirelessly control 240V electrical appliances by eye blink patterns. Programming is implemented on Python 2.7 assisted with OpenCV imaging library and Raspberry Pi 2 is used as the core computing board.  Designed a user efficient GUI which uses the detected patientâ€™s eye blink as a control signal to wirelessly switch on 240V lights, fan and relay prerecorded audio messages for associated help request.  Designed a Text Editor Interface and subsequent Voice Recitation feature that can enable patients to write text on to a computer coupled with an option to recite it to a listener solely controlled by voluntary eye blinks.
